SQLMap: The Basics
That the website asks the database to retrieve, store, or modify any data.
------------SQL Injection Vulnerability-------------------
Concept		What it does		Question it answers
Validation	Checks input	“Should this input be allowed?”
Sanitization	Cleans input	“How do I make this input safe?”

1. Input Sanitization (SQL context)
Meaning:

Cleaning or escaping user input so it cannot break SQL syntax, even if it contains dangerous characters.

2. Input Validation (SQL context)

Meaning:
Checking whether the user input is correct, expected, and allowed before it reaches the database.

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' AND password = 'abc' OR 1=1;-- -';

The -- - at the end of the query would comment anything after 1=1, which means the query would be successfully executed, and the attacker would get logged in to John’s user account.

---------------------Automated SQL Injection Tool-------------------------
SQLMap is an automated tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It simplifies the process of identifying these vulnerabilities. 

 --wizard flag with SQLMap.
(ask question related to scan)


(1) The --dbs flag helps you to extract all the database names. 
(2) To see tables: -D database_name --table
(3)Enumerate the records in those tables: -D database_name -T table_name --dump


SQLMAP WITH GET PRARAMETER----------
That URL with the -u flag in the SQLMap tool. This is considered to be HTTP GET-based testing

sqlmap -u http://sqlmaptesting.thm/search/cat=1

The results in the above terminal show us that different types of SQL injection

sqlmap -u http://sqlmaptesting.thm/search/cat=1 --dbs
sqlmap -u http://sqlmaptesting.thm/search/cat=1 -D users --tables
sqlmap -u http://sqlmaptesting.thmsearch/cat=1 -D users -T thomas --dump

WITH POST PARAMETER----
To follow this approach, you must intercept a POST request on the login or registration page and save it as a text file. You can use the following command to input that request saved in the text file to the SQLMap tool:


Important Note: You may not get the results by the simple scan; add --level=5 at the end of your commands to perform the in-depth scans. Secondly, while running the commands, the tool may ask you some questions; make sure to respond to them as follows to run the scan smoothly:


So, to get the complete URL along with its GET parameters, we need to right-click on the login page and click the inspect option (the process may vary slightly from browser to browser). From here, we have to select the Network tab; then we have to enter some test credentials in the username and password fields and click the login button, and we will be able to see the GET request. Click on that request, and we can see the complete GET request with the parameters. We can copy this complete URL and use it with the SQLMap tool to discover SQL injection vulnerabilities inside it and exploit it. The complete request is shown in the screenshot below:
