Digital Forensics Fundamentals

Forensics is the application of methods and procedures to investigate and solve crimes

-------------------Digital Forensics Methodology-----------------------------
the process of digital forensics in four phases---	
Collection -- collecting the evidences: like mobile phones, laptops

On basis of collection phase digital forensics is divided into:
(1) computer forensics
(2) network forensics
(3) database forensics
(4) cloud forensics
(5) email forensics

Examination -data usually needs to be filtered
Analysis -analyze the data by correlating it with multiple pieces of evidence to draw conclusions

Reporting -report is presented to law enforcement and executive management
---------------------Evidence Acquisition--------------------------
STEP-1 
Proper Authorization - WARANT

WAY--1
Chain of Custody-Process of documenting the complete journey of evidence during a legal case lifetime, from the collection to final presentation in court.

WAY--2
Use of Write Blockers-A write blocker is a hardware or software tool used primarily in computer forensics to create an exact, read-only copy (image) of a storage device (like a hard drive or USB) by intercepting and preventing any write commands, ensuring the original evidence data remains untouched and its integrity is preserved for investigations

-----------------------------Windows Forensics---------------------------------
A disk image is an exact bit-by-bit copy of a storage device like:
.dd
.img
.E01 (EnCase)

A memory image is a snapshot of RAM (working memory) at a specific moment.

Disk imaging: dd, FTK Imager, EnCase
Memory imaging: DumpIt, Volatility, Rekall
