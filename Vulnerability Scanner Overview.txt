Vulnerability Scanner Overview

These weaknesses are known as Vulnerabilities. You start repairing the roof to fix this problem and keep your home safe. This process of fixing the vulnerabilities is known as Patching.

Small errors in code = weaknesses



-------------------------------------Vulnerability Scanning-------------------------------


Vulnerability scanning is the inspection of digital systems to find weaknesses.

This automated vulnerability scanning has made life much easier. You only need to install the tool and give it an IP address for a host or a network range for a network; it will start checking vulnerabilities and give you an easy-to-read report with the details of the vulnerabilities found.

These changes are referred to as Patches.

Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated Scans
Authenticated Scans:
	
The credentials of the subject host must be provided to the vulnerability scanner.	
2. Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attackers having access to the host.	
3. It provides a deeper visibility into the target system by scanning its configuration and installed applications.	
4. For example, scanning an internal database by providing its credentials to the vulnerability scanner.	


Unauthenticated Scans
The vulnerability scanner does not require the host’s credentials; it only needs the IP address.
2. Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an external attacker having no access to the subject host.
3. It is less resource-intensive and straightforward to set up.
4. For example, scanning a public-facing website for vulnerabilities that any user can exploit.

Internal Scans
Conducted from inside the network.	
2. It focuses on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside the network.
3. Identifies the vulnerabilities exposed to the attacker from outside the network.


External Scans
Conducted from outside the network.
2. It focuses on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside the network.
3. Identifies the vulnerabilities exposed to the attacker from outside the network.



----------------------------------Tools for Vulnerability Scanning------------------------


Nessus
Nessus was developed as an open-source project in 1998. It was later acquired by Tenable in 2005 and became proprietary software. It has extensive vulnerability scanning options and is widely used by large enterprises. It is available in both free and paid versions. The free version offers a limited number of scan features. In contrast, its commercial version offers advanced scanning features, unlimited scans, and professional support. Nessus needs to be deployed and managed on-premises.



Qualys
Qualys was developed in 1999 as a subscription-based vulnerability management solution. Along with continuous vulnerability scanning, it provides compliance checks and asset management. It automatically alerts on the vulnerabilities found during continuous monitoring. The best thing about Qualys is that it is a cloud-based platform, which means there is no extra cost or effort to keep it up and running on our physical hardware and manage it.



Nexpose
Nexpose was developed by Rapid7 in 2005 as a subscription-based vulnerability management solution. It continuously discovers new assets in the network and performs vulnerability scans on them. It gives vulnerability risk scores depending on the asset value and the vulnerability’s impact. It also provides compliance checks against various standards. Nexpose offers both on-premises and hybrid (cloud and on-premises) deployment modes.



OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System)
OpenVAS is an open-source vulnerability assessment solution developed by Greenbone Security. It offers basic features with known vulnerabilities scanned through its database. It is less extensive than commercial tools; however, it gives you the flavor of a complete vulnerability scanner. It is beneficial for small organizations and individual systems. The next section will explore this tool in more detail by performing vulnerability scanning.

------------------------------------CVE & CVSS-----------------------------------------
CVE:

CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Consider CVE a unique number for each of your inquiries and complaints. If there is any update to any issue, you can easily follow up on that using the unique CVE number. Coming out of the help desk example scenario, this CVE number is a unique number given to vulnerabilities. This was developed by the MITRE Corporation. Whenever a new vulnerability is discovered in any software application, it is given a unique CVE number as a reference and published online in a CVE database. This publication aims to make people aware of these vulnerabilities so they can apply protective measures to remediate them. You can find the details of any previously discovered vulnerability in the CVE database. An example of a CVE number given to a vulnerability can be seen in the picture below:

CVE-2024-9374
CVE prefix: Every CVE number has the prefix “CVE” in the beginning.
Year: The second part of every CVE number contains the year it was discovered (e.g., 2024).
Arbitrary Digits: The last part of the CVE numbers contains four or more arbitrary digits (e.g., 9374)


CVSS
CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System. If we return to the help desk example again, you would always need to prioritize the complaints. The most efficient way to prioritize the complaints is by their severity level. What if all your complaints are registered with a score ranging from 0 to 10, where a higher score indicates a more severe complaint? This would resolve the problem of prioritizing critical complaints. This is called a CVSS score. In the computing world, just as each vulnerability has a CVE number that uniquely identifies it, each has a CVSS score that tells you its severity. The CVSS score is calculated by considering multiple factors, including its impact, ease of exploitability, etc. The severity as per the CVSS scores can be seen in the table below:



CVSS Score Range		Severity Levels
0.0-3.9				Low
4.0-6.9				Medium
7.0-8.9				High
9.0-10				Critical

--------------------------------OpenVAS-------------------------------------------------
Docker is a platform that helps you create and distribute packages of different applications.

These packages are known as containers. A container of an application has all the dependencies already installed inside it, so we do not need to spend more time installing the application’s dependencies.


step to install docker in Linux:
sudo apt install docker.io

executing the following command with root privileges:
To Start Docker
docker start openvas

sudo docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas immauss/OpenVAS

(we will use the docker image provided by Immauss as it fits everything within a single docker image. This is enough for our lab work. We will run the following command to install the OpenVAS container with all the dependencies installed)
