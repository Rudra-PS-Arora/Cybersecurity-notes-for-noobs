Introduction to Incident Response
1. Cyber Security Incidents
2. like you planned for the security of your home, cyber security incidents also need some planning and resources to avoid huge losses.

------------------------Incidents-------------------------------------
TWO TYPES---> (A) Interactive (playing a game, open an application)
and
(B) Non-interactive incidents- Background processes

PROCESS -1
These incident are produce an outcome --> event (all events are looged on system solutions)

PROCESS-2
These event are then scanned by System solutions( a team of SOC analyst and security tools and technologies), if found malicious --> raise an alert

PROCESS -3
These alerts are then sorted into True positives and false Positives

PROCESS -4
These True positive are then labelled on their threat level and then dealt accordingly

------------------------Types of Incidents-----------------------------
 These types can occur independently or altogether within the same victim.

1.Malware Infections: Malware is a malicious program that can damage a system, network, or application. ex- phishing emails

2.Security Breaches: Security Breaches arise when an unauthorized person gets access to confidential data

3. Data Leaks: Data leaks are incidents in which confidential information of an individual or an organization is exposed to unauthorized entities.

4. Insider Attacks: Incidents from within an organization are known as insider attacks. Think about a disgruntled employee infecting the whole network through a USB on his last day.

5.Denial Of Service Attacks: Denial of Service attacks, or DoS attacks, are incidents where the attacker floods a system/network/application with false requests, eventually making it unavailable to legitimate users. This happens due to the exhaustion of resources available to entertain the requests.

 	CIA Triad
Confidentiality: Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to view it.
Tools: Encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and access control lists.

Integrity: Guaranteeing that data is accurate, consistent, and has not been tampered with or modified by unauthorized parties.
Tools: Digital signatures, hashing, and version control.

Availability: Ensuring that systems, networks, and data are consistently accessible to authorized users when needed.
Tools: Data backups, redundancy (failovers), and DDoS protection.

--------------------------------Incident Response Process---------------------------
TWO FRAMEWORK ----> SANS AND NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology)
These framework prove generic procedure to follow in an incident response.

 		SANS(SYSADIM,AUDIT,NETWORK AND SECURITY)

Preparation: Establishing policies, training, and tools before an incident occurs.
Identification: Detecting and verifying that an incident has happened.
Containment: Limiting the scope and impact of the incident (e.g., isolating systems).
Eradication: Removing the root cause and eliminating the threat from the environment.
Recovery: Restoring systems and services to normal operation.
Lessons Learned: Analyzing the incident to improve future responses.

 				NIST
Preparation: Building the foundation by establishing policies, tools, communication plans, and training for the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT).
Detection & Analysis: Monitoring for, analyzing, and verifying security incidents, identifying precursors and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
Containment, Eradication & Recovery: Limiting the scope of the incident (containment), removing the threat (eradication), and restoring systems to normal functionality (recovery).
Post-Incident Activity: Conducting lessons learned, documenting the incident, and updating procedures to improve future responses.


--------------------------------Incident Response Techniques---------------------
SIEM: The Security Information and Event Management Solution (SIEM) collects all important logs in one centralized location and correlates them to identify incidents.

AV: Antivirus (AV) detects known malicious programs in a system and regularly scans your system for these.

EDR: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is deployed on every system, protecting it against some advanced-level threats. This solution can also contain and eradicate the threat.

ALL THIS COMES IN SECONFD STEP OF SANS CYCLE--
(1) Playbook ---“What should we do?”
step-by-step instructions to deal with each kind of incident , these instructions are known as playbooks.Playbooks are high-level strategies that explain how to respond to a type of incident, including decisions and options.

(2)Runbooks--How exactly do we do it?”
on the other hand, are the detailed, step-by-step execution of specific steps during different incidents. These steps may vary depending on the resources available for investigation. Runbooks are step-by-step technical instructions that tell you exactly what to do in a specific situation.

| Term          | Meaning                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Threat        | Potential danger                |
| Vulnerability | Weakness                        |
| Incident      | Threat successfully causes harm |
